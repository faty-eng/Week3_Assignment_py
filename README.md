# Week 3 Assignment - Python Discount Program

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is a Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  

- If the discount percentage is *20% or higher*, the discount is applied.  
- Otherwise, the original price is returned without any discount.  

This assignment is part of *Week 3* for my course.

## âš™ How It Works
1. The program defines a function calculate_discount(price, discount_percent).
2. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The original price of the item.
   - The discount percentage.
3. The function checks:
   - If discount_percent >= 20, apply the discount.
   - Otherwise, return the original price.
4. The final price is displayed.

## â–¶ Example Run

Enter the original price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Final price after 25.0% discount: $75.00



Enter the original price: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 10
No discount applied. Price remains: $100.00
